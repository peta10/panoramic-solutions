# AI-Powered Highlights Setup

The email system now uses a hybrid approach for generating dynamic tool highlights in the Results Overview section.

## How It Works

### ‚ú® Hybrid Approach: Rules + AI Polish

1. **Rules First** - The backend analyzes:
   - User's top-ranked criteria (from their inputs)
   - Each tool's scores across all criteria
   - Picks 1-2 criteria where the tool is both strong (4+ rating) and aligned with user priorities
   - If tool is strong everywhere, tags as "Balanced performance across all areas"

2. **AI Polish Second** - Raw highlights are sent to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to:
   - Turn technical data into executive-friendly one-liners
   - Make language natural, polished, and varied
   - Keep within 12-word limit for email readability

### Example Transformation

**Raw Data:** "Reporting 5/5, Security 5/5"
**AI Polished:** "Standout in Reporting and Security for enterprise control"

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variable

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key and add it to your `.env.local` file

### Model Used

- **Model:** `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective, fast)
- **Max Tokens:** 50 per highlight
- **Temperature:** 0.7 (balanced creativity)

## Fallback Behavior

If OpenAI is not configured or fails:

- ‚úÖ System automatically falls back to rules-based highlights
- ‚úÖ No errors or broken functionality
- ‚úÖ Still generates meaningful, accurate highlights

### Rules-Based Fallback Examples

- Single strength: "Standout in Portfolio Management for specialized needs"
- Multiple strengths: "Strong in Reporting & Security for comprehensive control"
- No clear strengths: "Balanced performance across all areas"

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Accurate** - Rules decide what to surface (no AI hallucinations)
‚úÖ **Readable** - AI polishes language for better user experience  
‚úÖ **Consistent** - Each tool gets one clean, professional phrase
‚úÖ **Reliable** - Works with or without AI configuration

## Cost Considerations

- GPT-4o-mini is very cost-effective (~$0.0001 per highlight)
- Typical email with 3 tools costs ~$0.0003
- Monthly cost for 1000 emails: ~$0.30

## Testing

The system logs which approach is used:

```
ü§ñ AI-polished highlight for Airtable: "Exceptional reporting and analytics for data-driven teams"
‚ÑπÔ∏è OpenAI API key not configured, using rules-based highlights for MS Project
‚ö†Ô∏è AI highlight failed for Jira, using rules-based fallback
```

Check your server logs to verify the system is working as expected.
