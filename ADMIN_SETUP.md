# Admin System Setup

## Overview
The admin system has been successfully set up for the Panoramic Solutions website. It is completely isolated from the main website - users must go directly to `/admin` to sign in and access tool management features.

## Routes Created

### Standalone Admin Route
- **URL**: `https://panoramic-solutions.com/admin`
- **Location**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides a standalone admin interface with its own authentication

## Components Created

### Admin Dashboard
- **AdminDashboard**: `src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`
  - Standalone admin interface with built-in authentication
  - Reuses existing PPM tool admin components
  - Handles its own sign-in/sign-up and authorization

### Authentication Integration
- **Uses PPM Tool Auth**: The admin page uses the existing PPM tool authentication components
  - `@/ppm-tool/components/auth/AuthMenu.tsx`
  - `@/ppm-tool/shared/hooks/useAuth.ts`
  - `@/ppm-tool/shared/lib/supabase.ts`

## Architecture

### Isolated Authentication
- **No Main Website Integration**: The main website (panoramic-solutions.com) has no authentication
- **Standalone Admin**: Users must visit `/admin` directly to access admin features
- **Clean Separation**: Admin functionality is completely separate from public website

## How It Works

1. **Direct Access**: Users go directly to `https://panoramic-solutions.com/admin`
2. **Authentication**: The admin page shows a sign-in form if user is not authenticated
3. **Authorization**: The system checks if the user is in the `admin_users` table
4. **Tool Management**: Admin users can:
   - View all tools (regardless of status)
   - Edit existing tools
   - Add new tools
   - Approve/reject submitted tools
   - Delete tools

## Access Control

- **Main Website**: No authentication, purely informational
- **Admin Page**: Requires direct navigation to `/admin`
- **Unauthenticated**: Shows sign-in form
- **Authenticated Non-Admin**: Shows access denied with user info
- **Admin Users**: Full access to tool management dashboard

## Database Requirements

The system expects the following database tables to exist:
- `admin_users` - Contains admin user permissions
- `tools` - PPM tools data
- `criteria` - Rating criteria
- `admin_tools_view` - View for admin tool management

## Security Features

- Authentication required for admin access
- Role-based access control via `admin_users` table
- Session management through Supabase Auth
- Separate admin interface from public tools

## Usage

1. **Go directly to**: `https://panoramic-solutions.com/admin`
2. **Sign in**: Use the sign-in form that appears
3. **Admin verification**: If you're an admin user, you'll access the dashboard
4. **Tool management**: Use the full-featured admin interface
5. **Sign out**: Use the user menu in the admin header when done

## Key Benefits

- ✅ **Clean separation**: Main website remains auth-free
- ✅ **Direct access**: Admins bookmark `/admin` for quick access  
- ✅ **Secure**: No admin functionality exposed on main site
- ✅ **Standalone**: Admin interface works independently

The admin system is now fully functional as a standalone admin portal!
