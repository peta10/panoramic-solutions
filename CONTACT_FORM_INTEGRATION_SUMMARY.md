# Contact Form Integration Summary

## 🎯 Implementation Complete

I have successfully integrated your contact form with both Supabase (for data storage) and Resend (for email notifications to Matt Wagner). Here's what was implemented:

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. New API Route: `/api/contact-form-submit`
- **File**: `src/app/api/contact-form-submit/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles form submission, stores data in Supabase, and sends email notification
- **Features**:
  - Form validation (required fields, email format)
  - Sentry error tracking and performance monitoring
  - Dual functionality: database storage + email notification
  - Professional email template with action buttons
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 2. Updated Contact Form Component
- **File**: `src/app/contact/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Now uses the new API route instead of direct Supabase calls
  - Added submission ID tracking for analytics
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

### 3. Email Features
- **Recipient**: Matt.Wagner@panoramic-solutions.com
- **Email Content**:
  - Contact information (name, email, company)
  - Full message content
  - Timestamp (Mountain Time zone)
  - Quick action buttons (Reply, Send Calendar Link)
  - Submission ID for tracking
- **Professional styling** with company branding

## 🗄️ Database Integration

### Supabase Table: `contact_submissions`
Your existing table is already properly configured with:
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `name` (text, required)
- `email` (text, required) 
- `company` (text, required)
- `message` (text, required)
- `created_at` (timestamp with timezone)
- `updated_at` (timestamp with timezone)

## 📧 Email Integration

### Resend Configuration
- Uses your existing Resend setup
- Sends from: `Contact Form <noreply@panoramic-solutions.com>`
- Professional HTML email template
- Tagged for analytics: `contact-form`, `website`, company name

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your deployment environment:

```bash
# Supabase (for data storage)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://vfqxzqhitumrxshrcqwr.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Resend (for email notifications)  
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/contact` page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check:
   - Form submits successfully
   - Data appears in Supabase `contact_submissions` table
   - Matt receives email notification

### Automated Test
Run the included test script:
```bash
node test-contact-form.js
```

## 🚀 Workflow

When someone submits the contact form:

1. **Frontend**: Form validates and sends data to `/api/contact-form-submit`
2. **API Route**: 
   - Validates form data
   - Stores submission in Supabase `contact_submissions` table
   - Generates professional email with all details
   - Sends email to Matt.Wagner@panoramic-solutions.com via Resend
   - Returns success response with submission ID
3. **Frontend**: Shows success page to user
4. **Matt**: Receives immediate email notification with:
   - Contact details
   - Full message
   - Quick reply and calendar scheduling buttons

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Dual Recording**: Every submission is both stored and emailed
- **No Lost Leads**: Email notification ensures immediate awareness
- **Professional Presentation**: Branded email template
- **Action-Oriented**: Quick reply and calendar buttons
- **Analytics Ready**: Submission IDs and tracking
- **Error Resilient**: Continues if one system fails
- **Sentry Monitoring**: Full observability and error tracking

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- Form validation on frontend and backend
- Graceful degradation (email sends even if DB fails)
- Comprehensive error logging with Sentry
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry logic for transient failures

## 📊 Monitoring

The integration includes comprehensive Sentry instrumentation:
- Performance monitoring for API requests
- Error capture for both database and email failures
- Attribute tracking for form submissions
- Span tracking for end-to-end visibility

Your contact form is now fully integrated and ready for production! 🎯
